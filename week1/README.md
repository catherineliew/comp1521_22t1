# Week 1 Tutorial

Hello!

For those new to C, here are some [terminal commands](common_terminal_commands.md) and [resources/setup](c_intro.md) to refer to.

## Tips

Someone asked if I had any tips for the course. I suggest:
- Read the question/spec carefully. If stuck, read it again, as it is easy to miss something
- Ask questions on the forum and in class
- Learning to read man pages is very helpful (not so much for MIPS but for the C stuff later in the term)
- Read the course outline to get a feel for the course
- For the assignments, start early if you plan to do a lot of it

## Things I encourage in tutorials, especially for online ones
- I encourage you to **ask questions**, no question is dumb or silly, more than happy to help, that's what we're here for
- We are here to support you
- If you see me make a mistake, please point it out, thanks
    - Don't want to get to lab time, everyone is confused about something when it was actually just that I made a mistake somewhere
- It might be scary to ask questions or answer questions, I understand, that's super normal, but it makes classes a LOT more helpful and enjoyable if you try your best to, and it'll get easier with practice, I promise
- If you have any **feedback**, let me know, I'd really appreciate it, if I'm going too fast or too slow or if you didn't understand something I said, or anything else
	- I'm here to help you learn, you're here to learn
	- If you have any suggestions on what I could do better, tell me. Straight away in the chat is best, or later in the lab, or shoot me a message on blackboard, or send me an email later. Though it's better to give the feedback as soon as possible!
- If you want to speak with mic, I welcome that. If you want to turn on your cameras, I welcome that, please do. It's just nice to have some human interaction
